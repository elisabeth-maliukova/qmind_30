# qmind_30
NLP based Python program that aims to output a list of subjects needed to be addressed given public outrage event. 

TODO:
-find a way to remove unnecessary characters (like emojis) from the comments
-finding a way to extract "big ideas" from comments (see SOW for some ideas) 

Instructions on making the code work:
You guys will need to follow this tutorial to get this fully set up on your computers:
https://www.jcchouinard.com/get-reddit-api-credentials-with-praw/

Pretty much, follow that tutorial with the given files in the repo (the refreshtoken file is the same code he has in the tutorial), fill out the client secrets with your own reddit account details (so if you guys don't want to use your personal accounts you can make a dummy one).  After the client secrets are filled out, the scrapev3 file should work now, and you should be able to pull comments from a specific reddit thread (by URL).
